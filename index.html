                <p>
                    I am a dedicated technology enthusiast with a passion for exploring
                    emergent tech. My professional journey is driven by my curiosity,
                    which continues leading on me on new journies. Currently, I am
                    exploring coding and DevNet topics, expanding my skills in
                    programming and software. I gravitate towards anything that
                    inspires innovation and creation.

                        My first Python project was a recreation of my favorite game in the
                        CLI. This project helped me develop fundamental skills in OOP,
                        algorithms,and the logic of continuous operations. While I
                        obviously cannot share this project, I'm proud of the
                        accomplishment and happy to showcase it!

                        is a project that allows for creation of regex templates with
                        JSON/YAML to parse text and log files. It identifies files with
                        keywords and performs subsequent regex extraction. Comparisons
                        are supported as well, with an option to include a folder of
                        reference files that will output what target files did and didn't
                        match the reference files. Quickparse is highly portable, utilizing
                        the best of Python's standard library to achieve multiprocessing and
                        multithreading.

                        is a wrapper around OpenAI's GPT SDK designed to simplify
                        operations. It streamlines quick experiments by turning useful parameters
                        into executable commands, eliminating the need to consult documentation.
                        Commands include changing the model, adjusting temperature, setting
                        system prompts, and more. API key not included!
