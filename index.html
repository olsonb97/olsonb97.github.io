                </div>
                <p>
                    I am a certified networking professional (CCNA, Linux+, PCAP) with an
                    ever-growing passion for network automation and software development.
                    Currently, I am diving into API development and exploring REST 
                    through personal projects (detailed below). My curiosity drives me
                    to tinker with software, often exploring solutions to
                    self-created challenges <em>just to see what happens</em>.
                    However, I'm not afraid to reinvent the wheel if there's something of value to be
                    learned along the way, always embracing creative challenges that test me.
                    I see a future where network engineering and software engineering merge, and I
                    aspire to bridge that gap.

                        is a project that allows for creation of regex templates with
                        JSON/YAML to parse text and log files. It identifies files with
                        keywords and performs subsequent regex extraction. Comparisons
                        are supported as well, with an option to include a folder of
                        reference files that will output what target files did and didn't
                        match the reference files. Quickparse is highly portable, utilizing
                        the best of Python's standard library to achieve multiprocessing and
                        multithreading.

                        is a wrapper around OpenAI's GPT SDK designed to simplify
                        operations. It streamlines quick experiments by turning useful parameters
                        into executable commands, eliminating the need to research simple settings.
                        Commands include changing the model, adjusting temperature, setting
                        system prompts, and more. API key not included!

                        is an interactive command-line application designed to explore Pokémon data in a 
                        user-friendly way. It has served as my primary project for understanding HTTP, REST, 
                        API integration, and Python's <strong>cmd</strong> module. The program fetches
                        real-time data from PokeAPI, allowing users to search for Pokémon, view their stats, 
                        moves, or compare any two Pokémon side by side.

                        I've written multiple applets and scripts that utilize <strong>pandas</strong> 
                        for matrix operations and abstract data conversions from various sources 
                        into a single operation. Depending on the specific requirements, I have 
                        worked with libraries such as <strong>csv</strong> for file handling, 
                        <strong>json</strong> and <strong>pyyaml</strong> for configuration management, 
                        <strong>regex</strong> for advanced pattern matching and text processing, 
                        <strong>os</strong> for system validation, and <strong>tkinter</strong> for 
                        building user-friendly interfaces.
